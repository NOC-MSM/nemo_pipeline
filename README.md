# NEMO Pipeline

**NEMO Pipeline** is a simple Python library to help scientists & ocean modellers quickly build reproducible data pipelines for calculating offline diagnostics using NEMO ocean general circulation model outputs.

The project utilises the `NEMODataTree` xarray object introduced in the [nemo_cookbook](https://github.com/NOC-MSM/nemo_cookbook/) library to enable users to customise & run scalable diagnostic pipelines for their ocean analysis or model validation.
